# Speech-to-Text Implementation

## Overview
Added speech-to-text (STT) functionality to the behavioral interview feature using OpenRouter's Whisper API.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Updated `/app/api/behavioral/stream/route.ts`
**Previous Issue**: The code was relying on Gemini AI to transcribe audio from inline data, which wasn't reliable and often failed.

**Solution**: Integrated OpenRouter's Whisper API for accurate speech transcription.

#### Key Changes:
- Removed dependency on OpenAI SDK
- Added OpenRouter API integration for Whisper transcription
- Audio is now transcribed using OpenRouter's Whisper endpoint before being analyzed
- Transcription is passed to Gemini AI for analysis alongside video frames

#### How It Works:
1. Audio is captured from the user's microphone in the browser
2. Audio chunks are sent to the backend every 2 seconds
3. Backend converts audio to base64 and sends it to OpenRouter's Whisper API
4. Whisper returns accurate transcription
5. Transcription is:
   - Sent back to the frontend for display
   - Used by Gemini AI to analyze speech clarity and confidence
   - Saved for the interview session

### 2. Updated `.env.local`
Added the OpenRouter API key to enable Whisper transcription:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Get your API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and add it to `.env.local`

## API Endpoint Used
**OpenRouter Whisper Endpoint**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/audio/transcriptions`

**Request Format**:
```json
{
  "model": "whisper-1",
  "file": "<base64-encoded-audio>",
  "language": "en"
}
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "text": "transcribed text here..."
}
```

## Features Now Working

### ‚úÖ Real-time Speech Transcription
- Audio from the user is transcribed in real-time during behavioral interviews
- Transcription appears in the "Live Transcript" section of the UI
- Accurate word-for-word transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model via OpenRouter

### ‚úÖ Speech Analysis
- **Speech Clarity**: Analyzed based on actual transcribed words
- **Tone Confidence**: Inferred from word choice and sentence structure
- Metrics are calculated more accurately with real transcription data

### ‚úÖ Context-Aware Coaching
- AI coach can see what the user actually said
- Provides better feedback based on real responses
- Improved quality of live insights and recommendations

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to a behavioral interview session**:
   - Go to Mock Interviews
   - Select "Behavioral" mode
   - Start a new session

3. **Grant microphone and camera permissions** when prompted

4. **Click "Start Interview Session"**

5. **Speak your answer** to the behavioral question

6. **Watch the Live Transcript section** - you should see your words appearing in real-time

7. **Check the console** for logs:
   - Look for: `üé§ [Behavioral Stream] Transcribing audio with OpenRouter Whisper...`
   - Success: `‚úÖ [Behavioral Stream] Whisper transcription: [your words]...`

## Troubleshooting

### Transcription Not Working?
1. **Check API Key**: Ensure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
2. **Restart Dev Server**: Changes to `.env.local` require a server restart
3. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages in the browser console and terminal
4. **Audio Format**: Ensure browser supports WebM audio (Chrome, Edge, Firefox do)

### Seeing "‚ö†Ô∏è OpenRouter Whisper failed"?
- Check the error message in console
- Verify API key is valid and has credits
- Check OpenRouter dashboard for usage limits

### No Audio Being Recorded?
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check that MediaRecorder is supported in your browser
- Verify audio chunks are being captured (check browser console)

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Accurate Transcription**: Whisper is one of the best STT models available
2. **No SDK Dependencies**: Uses simple fetch API calls
3. **Reliable**: OpenRouter provides stable API access to Whisper
4. **Better Analysis**: Gemini AI can provide better feedback with real transcriptions
5. **User Feedback**: Users can see exactly what was transcribed

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

- [ ] Add transcript download/export feature
- [ ] Implement transcript editing if transcription is incorrect
- [ ] Add support for multiple languages
- [ ] Cache transcriptions to reduce API calls
- [ ] Add timestamp markers for longer sessions
- [ ] Implement sentiment analysis on transcripts

## API Usage Notes

**OpenRouter Whisper Costs**:
- Check current pricing at: https://openrouter.ai/docs
- Whisper is typically very affordable
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production

**API Key Security**:
- The API key is stored in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- In production, use environment variables
- Consider implementing API key rotation

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/behavioral/stream/route.ts` - Main transcription logic
2. `.env.local` - Added OpenRouter API key

## Files That Use This Feature

- `/components/interview/BehavioralLive.tsx` - Displays transcription
- `/app/api/behavioral/stream/route.ts` - Handles transcription
- All behavioral interview sessions benefit from this feature
