# Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Behavioral Metrics - Top 3 Metrics Not Working ✅

**Problem**: The top three metrics (speechClarity, toneConfidence, emotionalStability) in the behavioral interview component were not updating correctly.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the metrics mapping in `BehavioralLive.tsx` to properly check for numeric values before updating
- Added type checking with `typeof m.speechClarity === 'number'` to ensure values are valid
- Improved the smoothing algorithm to better handle missing or invalid data
- Added proper fallback values when metrics are not available

**Files Modified**:
- `components/interview/BehavioralLive.tsx`

### 2. Behavioral Metrics Not Connected to Analytics ✅

**Problem**: Behavioral interview data was not being displayed in the analytics dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Added new `BehavioralData` interface to the analytics page
- Created `BehavioralMetricsChart` component that displays confidence, eye contact, posture, and speech clarity metrics over time
- Added behavioral interview feedback section showing recent interviews with scores and improvement suggestions
- Integrated behavioral data fetching from `/api/dashboard/behavioral` endpoint
- Added visual chart with color-coded metrics and legend

**Files Modified**:
- `app/dashboard/progress/page.tsx`

**Features Added**:
- Line chart showing trends in behavioral metrics over time
- Recent behavioral interview feedback cards
- Overall scores calculated from multiple metrics
- Key improvements list for each interview

### 3. Text-to-Speech Implementation with OpenRouter API ✅

**Problem**: No text-to-speech functionality was available, and the user wanted to use their OpenRouter API key.

**Solution**:
- Implemented OpenRouter TTS API integration in `/api/tts/route.ts`
- Used the provided API key: `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`
- Updated `useTextToSpeech` hook to:
  1. First attempt using OpenRouter API for high-quality TTS
  2. Fallback to browser's native Web Speech API if OpenRouter fails
  3. Handle audio playback with proper error handling and cleanup
- Added abort controller for canceling in-flight requests
- Implemented proper audio blob handling and URL cleanup

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/tts/route.ts`
- `hooks/useTextToSpeech.ts`

**Features**:
- High-quality TTS using OpenAI's `tts-1` model via OpenRouter
- Graceful fallback to browser TTS
- Proper audio playback controls (play, pause, stop)
- Loading states and error handling

### 4. AI Assistant Output Formatting ✅

**Problem**: AI assistant responses were not formatted nicely and appeared in "parsed form".

**Solution**:
- Enhanced markdown parsing in `AIResponseCard.tsx` to support:
  - **Code blocks** with triple backticks (```code```)
  - **Headers** (H1, H2, H3) with proper styling
  - **Bold** and *italic* text
  - `Inline code` with distinct styling
  - Bullet points and numbered lists
  - Proper paragraph spacing
- Improved color schemes for better readability:
  - Dark mode support with appropriate contrast
  - Code blocks with dark background
  - Distinct colors for different text types
- Added structured CSS styling with:
  - Better line height (1.75)
  - Proper spacing between elements
  - First/last paragraph margin handling
  - Pre-formatted text wrapping

**Files Modified**:
- `components/AIResponseCard.tsx`

**Formatting Features**:
- Multi-line code blocks with syntax preservation
- Hierarchical headers with different font sizes
- Styled lists with proper indentation
- Inline code highlighting
- Responsive paragraph spacing
- Clean, professional appearance

- Implemented type checking for metric values
- Added proper error handling throughout

### Performance
- Implemented audio URL cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Added abort controllers for API request cancellation
- Optimized chart rendering with proper data mapping

### User Experience
- Added loading states for TTS
- Implemented error messages for failed operations
- Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## API Endpoints Used

1. `/api/behavioral/stream` - Live behavioral metrics analysis
2. `/api/dashboard/behavioral` - Historical behavioral interview data
3. `/api/tts` - Text-to-speech generation via OpenRouter

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Behavioral Metrics**: Start a behavioral interview session and verify all 6 metrics update properly
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Check that behavioral data appears in charts and feedback sections
3. **Text-to-Speech**: Click the speaker icon on AI responses to test TTS functionality
4. **Formatting**: Verify AI responses display with proper formatting, including code blocks, lists, and headers

## Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-key>
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Notes

- The OpenRouter API key is currently hardcoded as a fallback but should be moved to environment variables for production
- Browser TTS serves as a reliable fallback if OpenRouter API is unavailable
- All formatting improvements are backward compatible with existing content
